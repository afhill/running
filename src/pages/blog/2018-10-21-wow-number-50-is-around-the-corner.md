Next weekend is the Marine Corps Marathon, which will be my 50th Marathon+!Â  Why the &#8216;+&#8217;? Well, I&#8217;ve done two 50Ks and I include them in that count. Two races from now, I may drop the &#8216;+&#8217; and celebrate again, we&#8217;ll see!

&nbsp;

Leading up to this one, I&#8217;ve gone back and forth on goal-setting, and finally came to the conclusion that I need to stop worrying about it. Back when I lived in Ohio, I ran a lot of marathons, and I loved it. I just went out and did it, and did well.

It was really once I joined a training group in Colorado that I started not enjoying running as much. Interestingly, I joined them in November after a strong self-coached half marathon, ran a huge PR in January and then kinda fizzled out after that. I tried to switch to focus on &#8216;speed at the half distance&#8217;, suffered an injury and haven&#8217;t been the same since.

Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t approached races accepting that.. which makes for kinda a tough time.

When I ran Houston in 2012, my coach had advised me to go out at a [faster pace than I thought possible](/gothedistance/houston-marathon-plan/). His recommendation was to &#8216;start with the 3:10 group and gauge how Iâ€™m feeling, how I can always see how I feel and if itâ€™s not my day, I can relax and let the 3:20 group catch me. His sense is that if I try to go with the 3:20 group and then pick it up near the end (what I was planning), that I will be dodging a lot of folks at the end and wondering if I could have done better.&#8221;

Sure enough, I ran a 20 min PR and amazed everyone except maybe that coach. I&#8217;ve tried that technique since then (go out and see how I feel), but it really hasn&#8217;t been what I&#8217;d consider a success. Maybe b/c at that race I was definitely open to the idea of doing the slower pace, whereas since then its b/c I wanted/expected to keep up with that faster pace.

&nbsp;

The result has been a lot of positive splits:

  * NYCM (Nov 2014):Â 1:46 /Â 3:38
  * Eugene (May 2016)Â 1:42 / 3:37
  * Maui (Jan 2017): 1:49 / 3:47
  * Harmon Lake Trail marathon (June 2017): 1:57 /Â 4:07
  * Boston (April 2018): 2:03 / 4:19
  * Ottawa Race Weekend Half (May): :53 /Â  1:49

&nbsp;

Except from the [Eugene race report](/gothedistance/2016-05-02-eugene-marathon-race-report/): &#8220;I wonder if I should have been more conservative: could I have done a whole 26.2 miles at an 8mm rather than 18 miles at 7:48, 2 at 8:15 and then 5 at 9:30. &#8221;

Now, just looking at those in order like that may also seem like I&#8217;m just plain ole getting slower, but I omitted Jack and Jill from that list b/c it didn&#8217;t have a negative split ðŸ™‚ The fact is, for Eugene, Maui and the Ottawa half, I started out at a pace I just wasn&#8217;t able to sustain.

So&#8230; why?? I used to just run, and love it. I&#8217;d love the feeling of comradery, and accomplishment. I am never, ever going to run anywhere near 3:09 anymore, and I actually don&#8217;t care to qualify for Boston again, so why does it even matter?

I feel like I just need to go out and enjoy it. Honestly, a lot of my runs lately I pick it up over time, so I think I just need to go out more conservatively and see how it goes, and enjoy it more. Because that&#8217;s why I do this&#8230; because I love running 26.2 miles at a time.

&nbsp;

Now, I say that.. but Marine Corps is next Sunday, and I&#8217;ve already seen that a guy I know from Denver is one of the pace leaders for the 3:45 pace group&#8230;. Should I? Gah, I&#8217;m such a hypocrite! ðŸ˜›
