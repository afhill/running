If you were to look at my race results since I rolled into the Masters category (age 40+, as of Aug 2017), you&#8217;d probably surmise my best running days were behind me. Well, they are.. but not by as much as you may have assumed.

In my marathon spreadsheet, I organize my races by finish time. The burgundy bars are different time-buckets. The green lines are races I&#8217;ve run since I turned 40. Notice how all of them are in that 4-5hr range, and they make up roughly half of all the races I&#8217;ve completed in that range over my running career.

Of course, this is where the caveats come in. That includes the three marathons of the Tahoe Triple, pacing my Mom to a sub-five hour race, and the Boston Monsoon of 2018. But still &#8211; just looking at the list, there&#8217;s a lot of green all clumped together.

Heading into the Marine Corps marathon, I didn&#8217;t let that weigh me down. I was ready to train well, run comfortable and let my body dictate what I was capable of. [And it went great](/gothedistance/2018-11-02-marine-corps-marathon-2018-race-report/)!
