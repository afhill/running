After the Montreal marathon-turned-half, I really haven't had a lot of interest in training for (or running) another marathon. But when we decided to take a quick trip to Philly, the half distance piqued my interest. 

To train for this race, Sara and I jumped into week 8 of the Hal Higdon Intermediate 2 Training program. We were pretty loose in following all the workouts, but it felt really great to ease up on the mileage and pressure on myself. Our peak mileage was something like 28 miles, and generally hovered just around 20 a week. This seemed so low! But it was really what I needed to recalibrate some of the "I should"s I've been feeling around running. 

I had a goal to run 1:45, an 8mm pace. 

We flew out to Philly on Thursday afternoon. Friday morning we did a running tour of the city and then worked from the Airbnb during the day, taking a quick lunch break walk over to the expo. In the evening, we relaxed with dinner at the Airbnb and watched Brittany Runs a Marathon. My favourite way to get ready for a race!

Race morning was a bit cooler than we had anticipated, and for some reason we hadn't packed mid-weight long-sleeved shirts. So, we called ourselves amateurs and ran in the race shirt! 

I wore regular saucony socks, my beloved Nike Vaporflys, capris, thin gloves, the long-sleeved shirt and a buff.  I tucked a couple fruit2s into the back pocket of my capris. It's so nice to plan for a shorter race in cooler weather and not have to worry about carrying water. (I should go back and see when I started doing this - I never used to!)

The race start was just over a mile from the Airbnb so we walked over. We thought we had plenty of time, but the security lines were insane! We waited for a long time before they hurriedly directed us to another door. We had just enough time to drop off our bags at gear check and run to the corrals. No time for a pre-race bathroom stop! Des and Meb said a few words before we started - so cool! 

I was in the black corral, and was surprised how quickly we got up to pace. The road was nice and wide very quickly. 


M1: 8:02<br />
M2: 7:47<br />
M3: 7:30<br />

I was feeling pretty great heading towards the waterfront - it was familiar from our running tour the day before. I glanced at my watch and realized I was a little quick, so I eased up a bit. I wanted to feel strong and comfortable throughout, if possible!

M4: 7:41<br />
M5: 7:51<br />
M6: 7:48<br />


The first half of the course was so much fun! It was pretty scenic and I felt great. It was around this time that I ended up close to an Achilles runner. It was cool; there was the blind runner, his guide and then another assistant who ran slightly ahead and let people know a blind runner was coming up behind them.  


I had started at the back of my corral and eventually I ran into the 1:45 pace group. I knew I didn't want to stick with them (plus, I had started behind them and knew I was a good minute ahead of that finish time) so I sped up to pass them and kept on going! 

M7: 7:38<br />
M8: 7:45<br />
M9: 7:40<br />

I won't lie, the second half of the course was tougher: less scenic, more remote and there were some little hills thrown in! But I felt like I still had plenty of gas in the tank (have I mentioned I'm a fan of this distance??)

M10: 7:48<br />
M11: 7:48<br />
M12: 7:16<br />

Around this time I head the call "blind runner behind you!" - The Achilles athlete had caught up. I asked the guides the runners name, and then was happy to cheer "go Irwin" as he SPED by me on a downhill. "Great job - save some beer for the rest of us at the finish!"

After a nice downhill on mile 12, mile 13 felt like a bit of a no man's land. I felt pretty depleted, but I knew I was close and kept gutting it out.

M13: 7:38<br />

Oh! So, still well faster than my target eight-minute-mile! That's great to see afterwards, but at the time I felt pretty sluggish. 

Last .1 (my watch says .25): 7:01 pace

For all the great things in this race, I was shocked there was no good signage for the finishing line! I ran towards the announcer and then all of a sudden there was the timing mat - didn't really have time to put in a final finishing kick! 

OFFICIAL: 1:41:56

I was so happy to come in at 1:41:56! I ran this exact time in the Dayton half in 2006, when I was 29. It's nice to still be able to hit that time thirteen years later, at 42! 

Sara came along not much later, at 2:02. We grabbed our gear and headed over to a wonderful Whole Foods, just outside the finishing area. It was perfect to warm up and find sustenance. It was crowded with runners getting food and drinks and warming up. Race organizers: I heartily recommend having a place like that nearby, because I was in no mood to hang around outside to buy something from a tent! 

After warming up, we headed home to relax. The other great thing about this distance is the time: we still had the whole afternoon ahead of us after the race. 

This was a really fun one - I felt like the training we did leading up to the race helped me feel confident and strong. I didn't go into the race with any fears and I felt I could push the whole way. Running marathons lately has been a lot more about biding my time in the first 13-20 miles before letting myself go. With this race, I felt I could set a pace and sustain it throughout. 

And I did! Looking back at my Strava race analysis, I was very consistent throughout:

The half marathon was the day before the marathon, so there was still a lot going on at the Race Expo. We managed to clean ourselves up and head back to the Expo in time to meet the inspiring DES LINDEN!!

Next up: we're headed off to Atlanta at the end of Feb to watch the USA Womens Olympic Marathon trials, and then run the half the next day. We're going to use the Hal Higdon plan again, but this time follow the entire 12 weeks. Looking forward to it!
